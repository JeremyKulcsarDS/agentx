    "# A* Chat\n",
    "\n",
    "As your application grows bigger, you may want to create more than one agent, each with a different set of tools to handle different part of the problem. Orchestrating a conversation between these agents can be challenging, especially when it is difficult to determind which agent should be called at each timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing multi-agent chat as a path finding problem, where each message in a message history is analogous to a node, and the message history as the path, A* algorithm can be used to find the optimal path to the end of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A* algorithm is a path finding algorithm that is widely used. It is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. A* algorithm is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm, which adds a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal. The heuristic function is an estimation of the distance between the current node and the goal. The algorithm will always choose the node with the lowest cost, which is the sum of the distance from the start node to the current node and the heuristic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using A* Chat, instead of having to manually program agent behaviours, you can simply define the heuristic function that estimates how *close* the message history to the goal, and the algorithm will automatically orchestrate the conversation between the agents to reach the goal."

    "1. **Account creation:** We guide you step-by-step in establishing your XEntropy account:the gateway to a host of agentic llm tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading tools from XEntropy:** Learn how to seamlessly and efficiently import tools from the platform into your environment to kickstart your foray into developing llm agents and intelligent applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Managing your account:** Your XEntropy account is useful for many things. Learn how to:\n",
    "    - **Purchase credit**: Convenience and accessibility are core to XEntropy. Understand how to replenish your account balance in a straightforward, user-friendly manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Get paid**: Having created applications or tools that other developers find useful? Here's how to benefit from your creations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Modify and delete tools**: As your skill level advances, so might your tools and applications. Learn how to adjust and remove tools from your portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Utilisation of logs**: Track your progress and rectify mistakes by understanding how to make use of logs effectively.\n",

    "## Loading tools from XEntropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic LLM is valuable in deducing, predicting, and problem-solving tasks where results need to be accomplished through sequential midsteps. When applying this pattern, you need to consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a clear Objective: This is the end goal that the agent wants to achieve. Explicitly specifying the objective helps guide the agent throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Break down the Problem: Define the context of the problem in chunks that the model can handle within its cognitive limit. This will facilitate better understanding and allow the model to take it one step at a time. You can create an agent for each chunk to faciliate the process. Refer to `composite-agents-tool` for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Formulate Actionable Steps: The agent needs to have means or steps to achieve the objective. Search on XEntropy to see if you can utilize existing tools to help with the process. If not, you can create your own tools to help with the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Monitor Progress: Track the progress of the model in each step to make sure it is on track and making progress towards the objective. If not, adjustments might be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing Hallucination: One of the challenges with LLMs is that they may end up creating information that is not accurate, also known as hallucinating. This can be managed in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Utilize Verifiable Sources: Whenever possible, try feeding the model with prompt that encourages the use of verifiable sources or requires the provision of source-based information. This increases the probability of information accuracy. You may refer to `rag-tool` and `api-tool` for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use Continual Feedback Loop: Applying a feedback loop between the user and the model’s output also helps in curbing hallucination issues. If the model’s output is incorrect, it can be traced back, analyzed, and altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. External Calculation and Validation: For tasks that require high preciseness and accuracy, external computations should be conducted. Also, results generated by the model should be cross-verified with facts. You may refer to `logic-tool` for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import specific tools from XEntropy, which are designed to provide updated and accurate information, alleviate model hallucination, and help with external calculations. These can be easily integrated into your existing applications and designed workflows to foster effective problem-solving using agentic LLM."
